  "summary": "# TL;DR\nMarie Curie (1867-1934) was a pioneering Polish-French physicist and chemist who conducted groundbreaking research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. Notably, she discovered the elements polonium and radium and made significant contributions to science and medicine, particularly during World War I. Despite facing numerous challenges as a woman in science, her legacy continues to influence modern research and medical practices.\n\n## Summary\nMarie Curie, born Maria Salomea Sk≈Çodowska in Warsaw, Poland, on November 7, 1867, made significant advancements in the field of radioactivity, coining the very term itself. She was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and remains the only individual honored with Nobel Prizes in two distinct scientific areas: Physics (1903) and Chemistry (1911). Her notable discoveries include the radioactive elements polonium and radium.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Curie faced various gender-related barriers in academia yet persisted, eventually becoming a professor at the University of Paris. In response to the needs of World War I, she developed mobile X-ray units that significantly improved surgical outcomes for wounded soldiers.\n\nCurie passed away from aplastic anemia on July 4, 1934, likely due to her exposure to radiation. Her legacy extends beyond her scientific contributions; she symbolizes perseverance and female empowerment in the scientific community. Honors commemorating her achievements include various institutions, awards, and a planned depiction on future euro banknotes, ensuring her place in history as a monumental figure in science.",
